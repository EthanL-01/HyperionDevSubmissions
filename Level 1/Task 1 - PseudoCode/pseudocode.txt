	Example 1:

define x as an empty list

loop until input equals 0
	request input from the user
	if input is greater than 0
		add input to x
	else
		print "Invalid input" 
		request input from the user again

print the largest integer stored in x

	Example 2:

define variable first_name 

request input from the user
	store the input in first_name

print first_name + " Hello, World"

	Example 3:

define y as 0
define z as 0
define number_sum
define number_average

define x as an empty list

loop the following until user inputs y
	request integer input from the user and store it in x
	add 1 to z

	if input equals y
		calculate the total of all integers contained in x and store in number_sum
		stop requesting input

divide number_sum by z and store in number_average
	print number_average

	Example 4:

define x as a list containing [baked beans, portable stove, matches, camping chair]

request input from user and remove any corresponding input from x
	print "Remaining items: " + x in alphabetical order

	Example 5:

define x 
	request input from user and store in x
define y
	request input from user and store in y

define S as x + y
define A as S divided by 2
define P as x multiplied by y

print S
print A
print P
