'''
Pseudocode:

Declare the following variables for item stock and prompt user for input
    app_stock, ora_stock, ban_stock, wat_stock

Create a list called menu with the following items and their stock:
    [("apple", 30), ("orange", 20), ("banana", 10), ("watermelon", 5)]

Convert the menu list to a dictioanry

Create a dictionary called price, and assign a price to each item in menu
    apple: 1.00
    orange: 1.25
    banana: 2.00
    watermelon: 3.50

Calculate the total stock value of each item together

Print the total
